# QAC SFIA2 Practical Project

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/a30d4a530d4d4c78995d77083cd6888a)](https://app.codacy.com/gh/keenan218/sfia2-project?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=keenan218/sfia2-project&utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

For this project we were tasked with deploying a prebuilt flask application. Said application consisted of a webpage showing entries from a mysql database, and a backend written in python. The deployment of this app required me to utilise most of what I have learnt in the academy up until this point. The main technologies used were: Ansible, AWS EC2, AWS RDS, Docker and Docker-Compose, Jenkins, Kubernetes and Terraform. 

## Project Brief
The project brief specified multiple things we had to adhere to and aim for during the course of this project. Some of these main points are listed below:
* Project must be deployed to a Virtual Machine for testing
* Project must be deployed in a managed Kubernetes Cluster for production
* Project must make use of a managed Database solution

## Planning
As with every project a great deal of time is spent on planning and preperation, this ensures the project runs smoothly and allows the developer to stay on track having a list they can go back to monitoring their progress. 

### Risk Assessment
As with all projects there are always apparent risks, no matter how small they might be. With this project in particular there is no greate amount of data being stored and not a great deal of thing sthat could go wrong, howvere if this is scaled up issues could become apparent more quickly. Below are some risks that I have identified:

### Jira Board
The Jira board helped with noting what my progress was throughout the course of this project, being able to move tasks from the 'to do' section into the completed section was a great relief, seeing such a large list dilute rather quickly.

## Project Infrarstructure
As directed by the MVP, the project is set up in a way of being as automated as possible. Terraform is utilised to create an EC2 instance and two RDS databases. Ansible is then applied to install jenkins on the vm which was created. A webhook was utilised which allowed me to have the jenkins pipeline triggered as soon as a commit was made to the source code provider (github). Once Jenkins is triggers it builds the project in a testing environment, permitting it reaches 100% in the tests it then builds the project in a live environment, with Kubernetes being applied to deploy the application.

### Ansible
Ansible was utilised in this project to download java and jenkins onto the Jenkins EC2 instance. This allows a quick set up of the jenkins service as i am able to run one command and it downloads to a specified vm and returns the jenkins admin password required for me to log on to jenkins and proceed in setting up my pipeline. Due to time restraints ansible wasn't utilised to its fullest potential, with a manual set up of Docker, docker-compose and a jenkins user still required after the ansible job has been played. 

### Docker & docker-compose
Docker and docker-compose (DC) are utilised to containerise the deployment of the project, backend, frontent, mysql and nginx are all split nto their seperate containers. DC is utilised to build the application in both the testing environment and the live environment. 

### Jenkins
Jenkins was utilised as the main component in this CI pipeline, the jenkinsfile was used to bring the code in from the SCM, SSH into both VM's, declare environment variables that have been previously configured in jenkins, connect to both test and live database and populate the databases and also run tests in the testing VM.

### Kubernetes
Kubernetes assists the user in deploying multiple images at once. In this case, it groups the app and allows you to run the whole app with just one command. Kubernetes is incorporated after jenkins and after the tests have been run. It launches the images, and connects to the database, allowing the data from the database to be accessible through port 80, on an IP generated by the cluster.

### Nginx
Nginx was utilised in this project, it is a web server which in turn gives advantages, such as being a reverse proxy and a load balancer. It handles all the requests sent to a web app, reducing the reliance on the web apps assets. In kubernetes it acts as a Loadbalancer. As kubernetes is a cluster deployment that means there are 3 nodes, Nginx plays a role here by sorting traffic evenly amongst the 3 nodes, effectively splitting the traffic between each node.

### Terraform
Terraform has been used to spin up the Jenkins VM and both RDS instances. Similar to ansible, due to time constraints terraform has also not been used to its fullest potential, It could be added to, by having the ability to also create both the test vm and the live vm. Ansible could also be integrated into terraform, omitting the need to manually set up individual vms like the jenkins vm. 

## Minimum viable product infrastructure diagram
The MVP has been reffered to a couple of times through this document, as such I have left the infrastructure diagram which was in the project brief as an indication to what I have followed throughout the creation of my project.
